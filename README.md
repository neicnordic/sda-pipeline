`sda-pipeline` is part of [NeIC Sensitive Data Archive](https://neic-sda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and implements the components required for data submission.
It can be used as part of a [Federated EGA](https://ega-archive.org/federated) or as a isolated Sensitive Data Archive. 
`sda-pipeline` was built with support for both S3 and POSIX storage.

## Deployment

Recommended provisioning method for production is:

* on a `kubernetes cluster` using the [helm chart](https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-helm/);

For local development/testing see instructions in [dev_utils](/dev_utils) folder.

## Core Components

| Component     | Role |
|---------------|------|
| intercept     | The intercept service relays message between the queue provided from the federated service and local queues. **(Required only for Federated EGA use case)** |
| ingest        | The ingest service accepts messages for files uploaded to the inbox, registers the files in the database with their headers, and stores them header-stripped in the archive storage. |
| verify        | The verify service reads and decrypts ingested files from the archive storage and sends accession requests. |
| finalize      | The finalize command accepts messages with _accessionIDs_ for ingested files and registers them in the database. |
| mapper        | The mapper service registers the mapping of _accessionIDs_ (IDs for files) to _datasetIDs_. |
| sync          | The sync service accepts messages with _accessionIDs_ for ingested files and copies them to the second/backup storage. |

## Internal Components

| Component     | Role |
|---------------|------|
| broker        | Package containing communication with Message Broker [SDA-MQ](https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-mq). |
| config        | Package for managing configuration. |
| database      | Provides functionalities for using the database, as well as high level functions for working with the [SDA-DB](https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-db). |
| storage       | Provides interface for storage areas such as a regular file system (POSIX) or as a S3 object store. |
