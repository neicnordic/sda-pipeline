# sda-pipeline: finalize

Handles the so-called _Accession ID (stable ID)_ to filename mappings from Central EGA.


## Configuration

There are a number of options that can be set for the finalize service.
These settings can be set by mounting a yaml-file at `/config.yaml` with settings.

ex.
```yaml
log:
  level: "debug"
  format: "json"
```
They may also be set using environment variables like:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export LOG_FORMAT="json"
```

### RabbitMQ broker settings

These settings control how finalize connects to the RabbitMQ message broker.

 - `BROKER_HOST`: hostname of the rabbitmq server

 - `BROKER_PORT`: rabbitmq broker port (commonly `5671` with TLS and `5672` without)

 - `BROKER_QUEUE`: message queue to read messages from (commonly `accessionIDs`)

 - `BROKER_ROUTINGKEY`: message queue to write success messages to (commonly `backup`)

 - `BROKER_USER`: username to connect to rabbitmq

 - `BROKER_PASSWORD`: password to connect to rabbitmq

 - `BROKER_PREFETCHCOUNT`: Number of messagfes to pull from the message server at the time (default to 2)

### PostgreSQL Database settings:

 - `DB_HOST`: hostname for the postgresql database

 - `DB_PORT`: database port (commonly 5432)

 - `DB_USER`: username for the database

 - `DB_PASSWORD`: password for the database

 - `DB_DATABASE`: database name

 - `DB_SSLMODE`: The TLS encryption policy to use for database connections.
   Valid options are:
    - `disable`
    - `allow`
    - `prefer`
    - `require`
    - `verify-ca`
    - `verify-full`

   More information is available
   [in the postgresql documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION)

   Note that if `DB_SSLMODE` is set to anything but `disable`, then `DB_CACERT` needs to be set,
   and if set to `verify-full`, then `DB_CLIENTCERT`, and `DB_CLIENTKEY` must also be set

 - `DB_CLIENTKEY`: key-file for the database client certificate

 - `DB_CLIENTCERT`: database client certificate file

 - `DB_CACERT`: Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the database to use

### Logging settings:

 - `LOG_FORMAT` can be set to “json” to get logs in json format.
   All other values result in text logging

 - `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to one of the following, in increasing order of severity:
    - `trace`
    - `debug`
    - `info`
    - `warn` (or `warning`)
    - `error`
    - `fatal`
    - `panic`

## Service Description
Finalize adds stable, shareable _Accession ID_'s to archive files.
When running, finalize reads messages from the configured RabbitMQ queue (default "accessionIDs").
For each message, these steps are taken (if not otherwise noted, errors halt progress and the service moves on to the next message):

1. The message is validated as valid JSON that matches the "ingestion-accession" schema (defined in sda-common).
If the message can’t be validated it is discarded with an error message in the logs.

1. if the type of the `DecryptedChecksums` field in the message is `sha256`, the value is stored.

1. A new RabbitMQ "complete" message is created and validated against the "ingestion-completion" schema.
If the validation fails, an error message is written to the logs.

1. The file accession ID in the message is marked as "ready" in the database.
On error the service sleeps for up to 5 minutes to allow for database recovery, after 5 minutes the message is Nacked, re-queued and an error message is written to the logs.

1. The complete message is sent to RabbitMQ. On error, a message is written to the logs.

1. The original RabbitMQ message is Ack'ed.

## Communication

 - Finalize reads messages from one rabbitmq queue (default `accessionIDs`).

 - Finalize writes messages to one rabbitmq queue (default `backup`).

 - Finalize assigns the accesion ID to a file in the database using the `SetAccessionID` function.
