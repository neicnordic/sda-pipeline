# sda-pipeline: mapper

The mapper service registers mapping of accessionIDs (stable ids for files) to datasetIDs.

## Configuration

There are a number of options that can be set for the mapper service.
These settings can be set by mounting a yaml-file at `/config.yaml` with settings.

ex.
```yaml
log:
  level: "debug"
  format: "json"
```
They may also be set using environment variables like:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export LOG_FORMAT="json"
```

### RabbitMQ broker settings

These settings control how mapper connects to the RabbitMQ message broker.

 - `BROKER_HOST`: hostname of the rabbitmq server

 - `BROKER_PORT`: rabbitmq broker port (commonly `5671` with TLS and `5672` without)

 - `BROKER_QUEUE`: message queue to read messages from (commonly `mapper`)

 - `BROKER_USER`: username to connect to rabbitmq

 - `BROKER_PASSWORD`: password to connect to rabbitmq

 - `BROKER_PREFETCHCOUNT`: Number of messages to pull from the message server at the time (default to 2)

### PostgreSQL Database settings:

 - `DB_HOST`: hostname for the postgresql database

 - `DB_PORT`: database port (commonly 5432)

 - `DB_USER`: username for the database

 - `DB_PASSWORD`: password for the database

 - `DB_DATABASE`: database name

 - `DB_SSLMODE`: The TLS encryption policy to use for database connections.
   Valid options are:
    - `disable`
    - `allow`
    - `prefer`
    - `require`
    - `verify-ca`
    - `verify-full`

   More information is available
   [in the postgresql documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION)

   Note that if `DB_SSLMODE` is set to anything but `disable`, then `DB_CACERT` needs to be set,
   and if set to `verify-full`, then `DB_CLIENTCERT`, and `DB_CLIENTKEY` must also be set

 - `DB_CLIENTKEY`: key-file for the database client certificate

 - `DB_CLIENTCERT`: database client certificate file

 - `DB_CACERT`: Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the database to use

### Logging settings:

 - `LOG_FORMAT` can be set to “json” to get logs in json format.
   All other values result in text logging

 - `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to one of the following, in increasing order of severity:
    - `trace`
    - `debug`
    - `info`
    - `warn` (or `warning`)
    - `error`
    - `fatal`
    - `panic`

## Service Description

The mapper service maps file accessionIDs to datasetIDs.

When running, mapper reads messages from the configured RabbitMQ queue (default: "mappings").  
For each message, these steps are taken (if not otherwise noted, errors halt progress and the service moves on to the next message):

1. The message is validated as valid JSON that matches the "dataset-mapping" schema (defined in sda-common).  
If the message can’t be validated it is discarded with an error message in the logs.

1. AccessionIDs from the message are mapped to a datasetID (also in the message) in the database.  
On error the service sleeps for up to 5 minutes to allow for database recovery, after 5 minutes the message is Nacked, re-queued and an error message is written to the logs.

1. The uploaded files for each AccessionID is removed from the inbox  
If this fails an error will be written to the logs.

2. The RabbitMQ message is Ack'ed.


## Communication

 - Mapper reads messages from one rabbitmq queue (default `mappings`).

 - Mapper maps files to datasets in the database using the `MapFilesToDataset` function.
